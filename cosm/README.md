# üåå Cosmos Hub Account Manager

A frontend-only JavaScript application that creates Cosmos Hub accounts, monitors ATOM token transfers, and automatically stakes received tokens. This application runs entirely in the browser without requiring any backend infrastructure.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Account Creation**: Generate new Cosmos Hub accounts with secure mnemonic phrases
- **Balance Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of ATOM token balances
- **Auto-Staking**: Automatically stake received ATOM tokens when they meet a configurable threshold
- **Transaction History**: Track incoming and outgoing transactions
- **Manual Staking**: Manually stake ATOM tokens to validators
- **Persistent Storage**: Save account information locally for easy access
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface with real-time status updates

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection (for loading Cosmos SDK libraries and connecting to Cosmos Hub)

### Running the Application

1. **Clone or download the project files**
2. **Start a local server** (required for proper functionality):
   ```bash
   # Using Python (if available)
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server -p 8000
   
   # Using npm scripts
   npm run serve
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## üìã How It Works

### 1. Account Creation
- Click "Create New Account" to generate a new Cosmos Hub account
- The application generates a secure 24-word mnemonic phrase
- Your account address is displayed for receiving ATOM tokens
- **Important**: Save your mnemonic phrase securely - you'll need it to access your account

### 2. Balance Monitoring
- The application connects to the Cosmos Hub network via RPC
- Real-time balance updates every 30 seconds when monitoring is active
- Transaction history shows incoming and outgoing transfers

### 3. Auto-Staking
- Enable auto-staking to automatically stake received ATOM tokens
- Set a minimum threshold for auto-staking (default: 0.1 ATOM)
- When someone transfers ATOM to your account and the amount meets the threshold, it's automatically staked

### 4. Manual Staking
- Enter a validator address and stake amount
- Click "Stake ATOM" to manually stake tokens
- Default validator: `cosmosvaloper1gghjut3ccd8ay0zduzj64hwre2fxs9ldmqhffj`

## üîß Configuration

### Network Settings
The application connects to the official Cosmos Hub network:
- **RPC Endpoint**: `https://rpc.cosmos.network:26657`
- **Chain ID**: `cosmoshub-4`
- **Gas Price**: `0.025uatom`
- **Gas Limit**: `200000`

### Auto-Staking Settings
- **Enabled/Disabled**: Toggle auto-staking on/off
- **Threshold**: Minimum ATOM amount to trigger auto-staking
- **Validator**: Default validator address (can be changed)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Important Warnings
- **Mnemonic Security**: Your mnemonic phrase is the key to your account. Keep it secure and private
- **Local Storage**: Account information is stored in your browser's localStorage
- **Network Connection**: The application requires internet access to connect to Cosmos Hub
- **Browser Security**: Ensure you're using a secure, up-to-date browser

### Best Practices
1. **Backup your mnemonic**: Write it down and store it securely offline
2. **Use a dedicated browser**: Consider using a separate browser profile for crypto applications
3. **Regular backups**: Export your account information regularly
4. **Test with small amounts**: Start with small ATOM transfers to test functionality

## üîå Technical Details

### Dependencies
The application uses the following external libraries (loaded via CDN):
- `@cosmjs/cosmjs`: Core Cosmos SDK functionality
- `@cosmjs/crypto`: Cryptographic operations
- `@cosmjs/proto-signing`: Transaction signing
- `@cosmjs/stargate`: Stargate client for Cosmos Hub

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome**: 80+
- **Firefox**: 75+
- **Safari**: 13+
- **Edge**: 80+

### Local Storage
The application stores the following data locally:
- Account address
- Mnemonic phrase (encrypted in production)
- Account name
- Auto-staking preferences

## üö® Limitations

### Current Implementation
This is a demonstration application with the following limitations:

1. **Simulated Staking**: The staking functionality is simulated for demonstration purposes
2. **No Real Transactions**: Actual blockchain transactions are not broadcast
3. **Limited Validator Info**: Basic validator address validation
4. **Demo Mode**: Balance monitoring works with real data, but staking is simulated

### Production Considerations
For production use, consider:
- Implementing proper transaction signing and broadcasting
- Adding comprehensive error handling
- Implementing proper security measures
- Adding validator information and selection
- Implementing proper gas estimation
- Adding transaction confirmation tracking

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cosmos SDK Libraries Not Loaded"**
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page
- Try a different browser

**"Connection Failed"**
- Verify internet connectivity
- Check if the Cosmos Hub RPC endpoint is accessible
- Try refreshing the page

**"Failed to Create Account"**
- Ensure you're using a modern browser
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Try clearing browser cache and cookies

**"Balance Not Updating"**
- Verify the account address is correct
- Check if the account has received any ATOM tokens
- Ensure auto-staking is enabled for monitoring

## ü§ù Contributing

This is a demonstration project. For production use, consider:
- Adding comprehensive error handling
- Implementing proper security measures
- Adding unit tests
- Improving the UI/UX
- Adding more validator options
